# What I'm Doing Now

### Updated on November 27th, 2024, from my home office on the Moon.

The Now page is all about giving your readers a snapshot of what’s currently happening in your life. Inspired by the [Now movement](https://nownownow.com), this page is a way to share what you’re focused on at the moment—whether that’s work, hobbies, travel, or personal growth.

Here are some ideas for what you might include:
- **What You're Working On:** Highlight your current projects, whether they’re professional, creative, or personal.
- **What You’re Learning:** Share any books, courses, or new skills you’re exploring.
- **Where You Are:** Mention if you’re traveling, living somewhere new, or just enjoying time in your usual environment.
- **What’s Important Right Now:** Reflect on what’s taking priority in your life at this stage.

The Now page is dynamic—it’s meant to be updated regularly so visitors always know what’s new with you. Think of it as a more personal, meaningful alternative to the fleeting updates of social media.

With Kondo, it’s easy to update your Now page. Simply open the `content/now.md` file and make your changes. The design ensures that this page fits seamlessly with the rest of your site.

What you include is entirely up to you—keep it short and focused, or expand with details about what makes this moment unique. Either way, it’s a great way to keep your site personal and relevant.
